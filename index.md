<p style="text-align: center;">Hello Everyone this is the PS2 Switch &nbsp;background , settings user select and &nbsp;initial homebrew menu themes for the switch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To install this: first make sure you have the nxthemes &nbsp;downloaded on your switch from the homebrew channel shop&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">or you can get it here lol :<a href="https://gbatemp.net/download/nxthemes-installer.35408/">NXThemes Installer | GBAtemp.net - The Independent Video Game Community</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then to install it you will need to create a &quot;themes folder on your sd card like so:

  <p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">move the files in this Github to that and then you can go inside of the application (nxthemes) on the switch and the install like so, by selecting them from your SD card I tried to label them for everyone for ease of use haha&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I really wanted to do the boot animation and have it as the ps2 but it was either patched out or i was doing it wrong (basically instead of saying nintendo switch it would say nintendo switch with the ps2 background you can see this is what I used for the main initial menu for atmosphere) anyways enjoy just something fun now for some screenies :D</p>
